Pathogenic human CoVs, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, killed approximately 36% of infected patients in Saudi Arabia and South Korea [2] [3] [4] . It is alarming the new and deadly CoVs can emerge at any time with the potential to become pandemics. Unfortunately, neither a protective vaccine nor an effective antiviral agent for the prevention and treatment of SARS is available. Therefore, continued development of therapeutic and prophylactic countermeasures against potentially deadly CoVs is warranted. The SARS-CoV is a crown-like enveloped virus that contains a positive-strand RNA whose genome sequence exhibits only moderate homology to other known CoVs 5 . Since SARS-CoV proteases (3-chymotrypsin-like protease [3CL pro ] and papain-like protease [PL pro ]) are synthesized as large precursor proteins that are cleaved to generate mature active proteins and their structures are conserved across the CoV genera, targeting these proteins is an effective antiviral strategy in suppressing viral genome replication to cure CoV infection 1, 6 .", "denotations": [{"id": "Disease_COVID-19", "phrase": "new coronavirus", "start": 381, "end": 396}]}, {"text": "Because of the close association of camels with humans and the role played by camels in the emergence and transmission of MERS-CoV, it has become increasingly clear that camels are a critical intermediary in the transmission of viruses to humans. Thus, it is important to understand the repertoire of viruses that camels harbor and their zoonotic potential. Here we report the first study of camel respiratory viromes. Our results demonstrate that camels carry a wide variety of mammalian viruses. Among the different viruses detected in this study, some were similar or nearly identical to previously described camel viruses (96-99.7% nt identity), such as camel MERS-CoV, camel alpha-CoV, camel CoV HKU23, dromedary astrovirus, Camelus dromedarius papillomavirus, Orf virus, and camelpox virus. We also identified viral sequences that were similar or identical (92-100% nt identity) to viruses known to infect humans or animals other than camels, such as AAV, kobuvirus, and caribou feces-associated gemycircularvirus. Some viruses identified in this study, such as camel CCHFV Abu Dhabi, camel PIV3 Abu Dhabi, camel PIV4 Abu Dhabi, and camel bocavirus 3 Abu Dhabi, only shared a moderate similarity to the known viruses (84-89% nt identity), and are potentially novel. Complete genome sequencing of these viruses including camel CCHFV Abu Dhabi and camel PIV4 Abu Dhabi would further ascertain whether they should be considered novel strains or novel species. Finally, we identified sequences of a novel camel polyomavirus, camel polyomavirus Abu Dhabi most closely related to a sheep polyomavirus, with 62-69% nt identity in different gene regions. Camel alpha-CoV has been very recently found to co-circulate with MERS-CoV in camels from Saudi Arabia with a coinfection rate of 56.6% by one study [17] and 3.5% by another [16] . In this study of camels from a single live animal market in UAE, we identified co-infection of camel alpha-CoV and MERS-CoV at a significantly higher rate of 92.6%, and co-infection of camel alpha-CoV, camel CoV HKU23 and MERS-CoV in 22.2% camels. This higher co-infection rate observed could be due to different camel population tested or sampling bias. Previous studies have shown that inter-and intra-coronavirus species recombination events happen frequently and are important for coronavirus evolution [47, 48] . Natural recombination between distantly related African bat coronaviruses resulted in a NL63-like virus, an ancestor of the human pathogen, human CoV NL63, suggesting that inter-species recombination may play an important role in CoV evolution and the emergence of novel CoVs with zoonotic potential [49] . In camels, recombination events between different MERS-CoV lineages in camels have been reported [17, 50] . A more recent study provided evidence for a cross-viral family recombination of a bat coronavirus and a reovirus [51] . The observation that camels are co-infected with different coronaviruses at a high rate further supports that camels may be a rich source for recombination and emergence of novel coronaviruses.", "denotations": [{"id": "Disease_COVID-19", "phrase": "novel coronavirus", "start": 3060, "end": 3077}]}, {"text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) have formerly been regarded as relatively harmless respiratory pathogens to humans.

Coronaviruses are enveloped, positivestranded RNA viruses of mammals and birds. These viruses have high mutation and gene recombination rates, making them ideal for pathogen evolution. 1 In humans, coronavirus is usually associated with mild disease, the common cold. Previous emerging novel coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which emerged in the Middle East in 2012, were associated with severe and sometimes fatal disease. MERS-CoV was less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, with the most severe infections mainly in individuals with underlying illnesses. Clinically and epidemiologically, the contemporary 2019-nCoV in China seems to resemble SARS-CoV. The genome of 2019-nCoV also appears most closely related to SARS-CoV and related bat coronaviruses. 2 The infection has now spread widely, with phylogenetic analysis of the emerging viruses suggesting an initial single-locus zoonotic spillover event in November, 2019, 3 There is an increasing focus on the human-animalenvironment disease interface, as encompassed in the One Health concept. Mortalities, disability-adjusted life-years, and billions of dollars of economic losses from these infections demand action and investment in prevention to face novel challenges to human and animal health. Research has led to better understanding of the nature and drivers of cross-species viral jumps, but the detail is still elusive. No reservoir population of bats for SARS and MERS-CoV or Ebola virus have been definitively identified, despite considerable searching, possibly because of the source virus circulating in small and isolated populations. Forensic examination has clarified the human infection sources and multispecies involvement in these diseases, with some species confirmed as competent hosts (eg, camels for MERS-CoV 4 ), bridge (or amplifying) hosts (eg, pigs for Nipah virus, non-human primates for Ebola virus 5 ), or deadend hosts. The crucial checkpoint is the jump and bridging of the viruses to humans, which occurs most frequently through animal-based food systems. In the case of SARS, markets with live and dead animals of wild and domestic origins were the crucible for virus evolution and emergence in the human population. Once the viruses' functional proteins enabled cell entry in civets (Paguma larvata) and racoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), the bridge was established and it was only a matter of time before the jump to humans occurred. 6 Sequence comparison of civet viruses suggested evolution was ongoing; this was further supported by high seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV among civet sellers, suggesting previous cross-species transmission events without necessarily human-tohuman transmission. 7, 8 Similarly, early Ebola virus was mostly associated with bushmeat and its consumption in Africa; Nipah virus is associated with date palm sap, fruit, and domestic pig farms; MERS is associated with the camel livestock industry; and H5N1 arose from viral evolution in domestic and wild birds, to ultimately bring all these cases to humans.

For example, TIME magazine called Taiwan a SARS Island [1] , that SARS sinks Taiwan [2] , and China as a SARS Nation [3] . The causative agent for the SARS disease was found to be a novel coronavirus, originated in bats and infected people most likely through wild animal markets [4] [5] [6] . The first known SARS case was a 45-year-old man in Foshan, Guangdong, China, in November 2002. Hong Kong was the first place for the global diffusion of the SARS virus when a 64-year-old nephrologist from Guangzhou, Guangdong, checked into room 911 of the Metropole Hotel in Kowloon in the night of 21 February 2003, checked out the next morning, been admitted to the Hong Kong Prince of Wales Hospital where he died several days later. Sixteen hotel guests and one visitor who stayed at the hotel on that night contracted the SARS virus, and carried the virus to Hanoi, Toronto, and Singapore. Figure 1 shows a time series plot of the spatial diffusion of the epidemic as the cumulative number of countries affected, daily reported SARS cases, and deaths. It takes the SARS virus about 80 days to spread over more than 30 countries, 100 days to infect more than 8000 people, and 120 days to cause about 800 deaths, a fatality ratio of about 1 in 10 [6] . The hardest hit regions are China (5327 cases, 349 deaths), Hong Kong (1755 cases, 299 deaths), Canada (251 cases, 43 deaths), Taiwan (346 cases, 37 deaths), and Singapore (238 cases, 33 deaths) (WHO, 2003) . The fatality ratios for these hardest regions ranging between 7% (China), 11% (Taiwan), Singapore (14%), and 17% (Canada, Hong Kong) [7] . The first recognized SARS case in Taiwan was a 54-year-old businessman who traveled to Guangdong, China, on 5 February 2003, and returned to Taiwan via Hong Kong on 21 February. He had developed fever, myalgia, a dry cough but was not hospitalized until 8 March 2003 [8] . It is unknown if this Taiwanese businessman had flew the same airlines with the Chinese nephrologist from Guangzhou because the day of their arrival in Hong Kong is the same, 21 February 2003. The wife and the son of this Taiwanese businessman were later hospitalized (on 14 and 21 Mar, respectively) and developed the novel SARS coronavirus. Most of the early cases in Taiwan were imported from China and Hong Kong [9] . We note that on 10 July 2003, there were 671 probable cases and 84 deaths. However, since 11 July 2003, 325 cases have been discarded. Laboratory information was insufficient or incomplete for 135 discarded cases, of which 101 died [7] . According to the World Health Organization (WHO) statistics [7] , 4.2% of global cases and 4.8% of global deaths had occurred in Taiwan. About 63% of the SARS cases were female, and 37% cases were male, and the median age for these cases is 42 (ranges 0-93) in Taiwan [7] . The reported SARS cases were concentrated in Taipei City and Taipei County (now called New Taipei City) [9] . About 71% of probable cases were located in Taipei City and Taipei County [10] . Both Taipei City and Taipei County are linked by the same underground massive transportation system. Almost 73% of all traceable infections in Taiwan occurred in hospital settings [11] .

These include those healthcare workers exposed to outside isolation settings, family and other close contacts, those on the airplanes with SARS patients (seated two in front of or three rows behind a patient) [8] .

Comparison of the interaction between the complex of ACE2 [13] and SARS-CoV RBD and homology model of ACE2 and 2019-nCoV RBD revealed similar binding modes (data not shown). In both complexes, \u03b25-\u03b26 loop and \u03b26-\u03b27 loop form extensive contact, including at least seven pairs of hydrogen bonds, with the receptor. Notably, R426 on the forth \u03b1 helix in SARS-CoV RBD builds a salt bridge with E329 and a hydrogen bond with Q325 on ACE2. However, the arginine (R426 in SARS-CoV RBD) to asparagine (N439) mutation in 2019-nCoV RBD abolished the strong polar interactions, which may induce a decrease in the binding affinity between RBD and the receptor. Interestingly, a lysine (K417 in 2019-nCoV RBD) replacement of valine (V404 in SARS-CoV RBD) on \u03b26 formed an extra salt bridge with D30 on ACE2, which may recover the binding ability.

Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of K22 and infected. Intracellular levels of the flavivirus E protein, as a marker of viral replication, were assessed by flow cytometry. Moreover, viral titers in the supernatant were determined by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) titration. This showed that both JEV and YFV replication ( Fig. 2a and c) and infectivity ( Fig. 2b and (Table 1) . Slightly higher K22 concentrations (\u054620 M) were necessary to significantly inhibit USUV ( Fig. 2g and h) and WESSV ( Fig.  2i and j), with IC 50 s being between 5.9 and 10 M (Table 1) . To analyze the antiviral effect of K22 on the hepacivirus HCV, a luciferase-encoding reporter virus was used, and virus-mediated intracellular luciferase expression was measured as a marker for viral replication. Furthermore, to rule out the possibility that K22 has an impact on the luciferase reporter activity, a nonreporter HCV construct (HCV Jc1) was employed and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of HCV RNA levels was performed (Fig.  S2 ). In addition, the viral supernatant from infected, K22-treated cells was harvested and used to inoculate naive target cells before the latter were lysed and luciferase reporter activity was determined (infectivity). Similar to the findings for WNV and USUV, nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay; Promega) as well as viability assays (proliferation; MultiTox-Fluor multiplex cytotoxicity assay; Promega) were performed to determine the cytotoxic effect of K22 on Vero B4 cells at 24 h posttreatment.

(f) Time-of-addition assays were performed to analyze the effect of K22 on the early virus-cell interaction. K22 at various concentrations was added at specific time points relative to the time of infection with ZIKV, and the cell culture supernatants were collected at 24 h p.i. for measurement of virus release.

K22 concentrations of \u054620 M led to a significant reduction of viral replication as well as infectivity ( Fig. 3a and b and S2 ). However, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell proliferation assays indicated that the cells used for infection were affected by K22 concentrations of \u054620 M (Fig. 3c) . Nevertheless, a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) value (21.3 M) 3-fold higher than the IC 50 (7.0 M) ( Table 2 ) revealed an antiviral effect of K22 on HCV which could be distinguished from the effect on cell viability. Nevertheless, careful interpretation of the data is still required, as the antiviral effect displayed by K22 may be overestimated in the context of HCV infections. Two biotypes of BVDV strain Suwa were tested for their susceptibility to K22 treatment. Viral RNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR as a correlate for viral replication, and viral titers in the supernatant were assessed by titration. Similar to the findings for HCV, K22 concentrations of \u054620 M and \u054640 M were necessary to significantly reduce the viral replication of Cp BVDV strain Suwa (BVDV SuwaCp) (Fig. 3e) and Ncp BVDV strain Suwa (BVDV SuwaNcp) (Fig. 3g) , respectively. Viral titers were significantly reduced upon treatment with 20 to 50 M K22 for BVDV SuwaCp (Fig. 3f) , with the IC 50 being 14.2 M (Table 2) , whereas at least 40 M K22 was necessary to significantly reduce the infectivity of BVDV SuwaNcp, with the IC 50 being 21.4 M ( Fig. 3h ; Table 2 ). Of note, even though no cellular toxicity resulting from K22 incubations at the concentrations indicated above could be measured, cell proliferation was affected at K22 concentrations of \u054630 M, as described before ( Fig.  3d ; Table 2 ).

These findings thereby corroborate a critical step inhibited by K22 during membrane remodeling events. Given these findings, we speculated that K22 might offer potential as a panviral inhibitor, considering that replication strategies are highly similar between members of the family Flaviviridae and other positive-strand RNA viruses. Indeed, we show here that several members of the Flaviviridae are efficiently inhibited by K22, with these viruses including ZIKV, JEV, YFV, WNV, USUV, WESSV, and, to a limited extent, HCV and BVDV. Moreover, combination treatment regimens with the approved broad-acting antivirals RBV and IFN-\u2423 supported the antiviral effect of K22 on ZIKV. This finding implies not only that effective K22 concentrations can be substantially reduced but also that the therapeutic window of K22 can be improved. Our results should also encourage efforts to improve the antiviral activity of K22 by assessing further chemical modifications to reduce possible cytotoxicity and the impact of K22 on cell proliferation and thereby enhance the therapeutic range of K22. Compartmentalization of the viral replication machinery within host-derived endomembrane structures is a conserved hallmark among positive-sense RNA viruses (11, 28, 29) and is hypothesized to provide optimized concentrations of macromolecules and to coordinate the regulated succession of events required for efficient viral replication. Furthermore, compartmentalization protects viral replication intermediates, such as dsRNA, from recognition by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors that elicit the first steps of a host innate immune response (30) (31) (32) . Time-of-addition experiments in the context of ZIKV revealed that K22 acts at a postentry stage, presumably during the establishment of viral replication in the cytosol of the infected cell, reminiscent of the suggested mode of action in the context of HCoV-229E inhibition (12) . Subsequent ultrastructural analyses of ZIKV-infected cells following K22 treatment revealed the predominant appearance of aberrant vacuoles in the cytosol of infected cells associated with the pronounced reduction of perinuclear dsRNA accumulation observed by fluorescence imaging. We therefore speculate that K22 interferes with the biogenesis of replicative organelles by prematurely abrogating membrane diversion functions leading to functional replicative structures. However, whereas K22 completely prevented were included as controls. The inoculum was removed after 1 h, and the cells were washed with PBS. At 48 h p.i., the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence analysis using antibodies directed against flavivirus E protein and dsRNA as markers of ZIKV replication.

In spermatophyte evolution, the AP2 group genes diversified but some functions might be conserved in the most recent common ancestor of extant spermatophytes.

AP2Ls are expressed in female and male cones, leaves, stems and roots (Vahala et al., 2001; Shigyo and Ito, 2004) . AP2L from P. abies shows functional similarities to AtAP2 in floral patterning when overexpressed in Arabidopsis (Nilsson et al., 2007) and the overexpression of AtAP2 also affects floral patterning in Nicotiana benthamiana (Mlotshwa et al., 2006) . AP2Ls are also expressed during somatic embryogenesis in gymnosperms (Guillaumot et al., 2008) . Remarkably, there are multiple homologous genes of the AP2 group in gymnosperms and their expression patterns differ from each other, though they belong to theAP2 type together with the AP2 clade in the phylogenetic tree, which implies that there has been a certain degree of functional differentiation in gymnosperm AP2Ls. Having gone through whole-genome duplication in the ancestral angiosperm, AP2 clade proteins in angiosperms likely had similar functions to gymnosperm AP2Ls inheriting from the common ancestor. This model is widely supported by the fact that AP2 clade proteins from Oryza sativa (Lee et al., 2007) , Zea mays (Chuck et al., 2007) , Hordeum vulgare (Nair et al., 2010) , Solanum lycopersicon (Karlova et al., 2011) , Solanum tuberosum (Martin et al., 2009) , Actinidia deliciosa (Varkonyi-Gasic et al., 2012) , Petunia hybrida (Maes et al., 1999 (Maes et al., , 2001 , and Crocus sativus (Tsaftaris et al., 2012) have been linked to AP2Ls and they function in floral organ identity and development, fruit development, lodicules development, branching and tuberization.

Excluding the polyadenylated tail at the 3'-terminus, the genome of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 was 30,129 nt in length with a G/C content of 45.4%. Comparative genomic sequence analysis indicated that Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 was most closely related to Ro-BatCoV HKU9 strains [18] with 66.6% -67.4% nucleotide identities.

Amino acid sequence analyses showed that the ORF1ab, S, NS3, E, M and N proteins of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 shared higher identities with Ro-BatCoV HKU9 strains than those of other betacoronaviruses ( Table 1) .

Homologous recombination events frequently occur during the viral RNA replication of coronaviruses, and are important for their evolution [10, [27] [28] [29] . However, it is also possible that coronaviruses are one of the few virus families that can experience heterologous recombination. For example, members of betacoronavirus group A possess an HE gene [30, 31] which was seemingly derived from ancestral influenza C virus, a negative-stranded RNA virus with a segmented genome [30, 31] , and which would represent another case of inter-family recombination, although it has also been proposed that the HE gene might be captured from host RNA [32] . Uncommon inter-family recombination events have also been reported in chicken infectious anemia virus [33] , bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 1 [34] , and recombinant viruses between Marek's disease virus, fowlpox virus, and various avian retroviruses [35, 36] . In the current study, sequence, phylogenetic and functional analyses demonstrated that the p10 gene of Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 was likely derived from an ancestral orthoreovirus, although that it occupies a divergent position in the phylogeny suggests that the direct ancestor of the recombination event has yet to be sampled.

Here, our determination of its crystal structure reveals that STI/A still adopts the dimeric structure almost identical to that of the wildtype (WT), only with a slightly change of the extra-domain packing, which is similar to that observed in the more active form of the WT at high pH values (pH 7.6 and 8) [44] . As a consequence, to understand its underlying dynamical mechanism, we conducted 100-ns MD simulations for both WT and STI/A. Remarkably, the most dramatic changes in STI/A simulations are associated with the nano-channel. This change appears to slightly enhance the dynamic stability of the N-finger and helix A, which subsequently relay the dynamic effects to the contacted residues and finally to catalytic machinery. Ultimately, the key components composed of the catalytic machinery become more dynamically stable, thus rationalizing the enhancement of its catalytic activity.

The importance of viruses as major causes of ALRI is becoming increasingly apparent because the sensitivity of detection techniques has greatly improved and new molecular tests increasingly replace conventional methods. The use of polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) now allows identification of viruses that have previously been difficult or impossible to culture. In the past decade, numerous novel respiratory viruses that can cause ALRI have been discovered, and new diagnostic methods for the use in high and low-resource settings alike are continuously evolving (3, (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . It seems that the conventional diagnostic methods have systematically underestimated the role of viruses as causal pathogens in ALRI (3) , and also that viruses are capable of causing severe, lifethreatening ALRI (3) . The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a novel coronavirus, and the avian influenza type A (H5N1) outbreak are good recent examples (16,20). Impressive progress has been made in the last decade in increasing the global availability of vaccines against the main bacterial causes of ALRI -S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type B -leading to marked reductions in both hospitalizations and deaths (21, 22) .

Strains of influenza type A and B viruses can be life threatening (3) , although infection in the majority of young children is vaccine-preventable (23, 24) .

However, this can sometimes be misleading because the results of phylogenetic analysis using different genes or characters can be different. When SARSr-CoV was first discovered, it was proposed that it constituted a fourth group of coronavirus [26, 27] . However, analyses of the amino-terminal domain of S of SARSr-CoV revealed that 19 out of the 20 cysteine residues were spatially conserved with those of the consensus sequence for Betacoronavirus [28] . On the other hand, only five of the cysteine residues were spatially conserved with those of the consensus sequences in Alphacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus [28] . Furthermore, subsequent phylogenetic analysis using both complete genome sequence and proteomic approaches, it was concluded that SARSr-CoV is probably an early split-off from the Betacoronavirus lineage [1] , and SARSr-CoV was subsequently classified as Betacoronavirus subgroup B and the historical Betacoronavirus as Betacoronavirus subgroup A. Therefore, the phylogenetic position of a coronavirus is best appreciated and confirmed by constructing phylogenetic trees using different genes in the coronavirus genome. The most commonly used genes along the coronavirus genome for phylogenetic studies include chymotrypsin-like protease, Pol ( Figure 2) , helicase, S and N, because these genes are present in all coronavirus genomes and are of significant length. The envelope and membrane genes, although present in all coronavirus genomes, are too short for phylogenetic studies. It is noteworthy that the cluster formed by the three novel avian coronaviruses BuCoV HKU11, ThCoV HKU12 and MunCoV HKU13, which was originated proposed as group 3c [2] , might represent a new coronavirus genus provisionally designated Deltacoronavirus (Figure 2 ). Using this approach of multiple gene phylogenetic studies, unique phylogeny of individual gene that may have biological significance may be discovered. During our phylogenetic study on Rh-BatCoV HKU2, another coronavirus that has was also found in the stool samples of Chinese horseshoe bats, its unique S protein phylogenetically distinct from the rest of the genome was discovered [15] . The S protein of Rh-BatCoV HKU2 is the shortest among S proteins of all coronaviruses and had less than 30% amino acid identities to those of all known coronaviruses, in contrast to other genes that showed higher amino acid identities to the corresponding genes in other members of Alphacoronavirus. When the S protein of Rh-BatCoV HKU2 is aligned with those of other members of Alphacoronavirus, many of the amino acid residues conserved among and specific to Alphacoronavirus were not found. Rather, the S protein of Rh-BatCoV HKU2 shares the two conserved regions of deletions both of 14 amino acids among members of Betacoronavirus in its C-terminus, suggesting that this segment of the S protein of Rh-BatCoV HKU2 may have co-evolved with the corresponding regions in Betacoronavirus. Most interestingly, a short peptide of 15 amino acids in the S protein of Rh-BatCoV HKU2 was found to be homologous to a corresponding peptide within the RBM in the S1 domain of SARSr-CoV. A similar peptide was also observed in SARSr-Rh-BatCoV, but not in any other known coronaviruses. These suggested that there is a common evolutionary origin in the S protein of SARSr-CoV, SARSr-Rh-BatCoV and Rh-BatCoV HKU2, and Rh-BatCoV HKU2 might have acquired its unique S protein from a yet unidentified coronavirus through recombination.", "denotations": [{"id": "Disease_COVID-19", "phrase": "new coronavirus", "start": 1902, "end": 1917}]}, {"text": "Over the course of less than 1 year (April 2013-February 2014), several novel corona viruses have been detected in the US including the PEDV prototype strain, the PEDV S INDEL strain and the porcine deltacoronavirus [14] [15] [16] .

In this study, using a replication competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) carrying the Ebola virus glycoprotein, a previously unknown entry receptor for Ebola virus was identified. Notably, these haploid cell screens identified six members of the HOPS complex, proteins known to play functions in endosomal/lysosomal trafficking, as well as the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) transporter as the most prominent hit of the assay. It is worth noting that NPC1 is not a surface molecule but rather an endosomal receptor. These findings led the authors to propose a novel mechanism of entry by which Ebola virus is internalized into the endocytic pathway, followed by endosome maturation and cleavage of the surface glycoprotein of the virus. Endosome fusion, mediated by the HOPS complex, would allow interaction with NCP1 containing endosomes, triggering fusion and release of the viral genome into the cytosol. Multiple cell surface receptors can lead to internalization of the Ebola virus into the endocytic pathway [131] ; such redundancy in receptor usage likely explains why these receptors were not identified in the haploid cell screen [47] . Notably, independent studies have confirmed that NCP1 acts an intracellular receptor for Ebola, including a chemical screen approach, a study showing NCP1 dependence for infection of otherwise nonsusceptible cells, and more recently the elucidation of the crystal structure of this receptor bound to the Ebola virus glycoprotein [132] [133] [134] .", "denotations": [{"id": "Virus_SARS-CoV-2", "phrase": "ncp", "start": 1097, "end": 1100}]}, {"text": "Interestingly, after the aforementioned haploid genetic screens identified NCP1 as a noncanonical entry receptor (given its intracellular localization), other filoviruses have been shown to take advantage of this receptor [135] . The relevance of this intriguing mechanism of viral entry is further reinforced by recent work on Lassa virus, an Old World Arenavirus that, similarly to Ebola virus, causes severe to fatal hemorrhagic disease in humans [48, 136] . A genome-wide haploid screen using VSV pseudotyped with Lassa glycoprotein was performed in order to identify host factors essential for viral entry. Although -dystroglycan (DAG1) was long recognized as the cell surface receptor for Lassa virus, additional factors were suspected, given the observation that certain DAG1-expressing cells are resistant to infection. The authors elegantly demonstrated that at a neutral pH, the Lassa virus glycoprotein was bound to DAG1, whereas upon exposure to lower pH (resembling the lysosome environment), a receptor switch occurred leading to strong association with the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) [48] . Thus, similarly to Ebola virus, in the model suggested the virus would be incorporated into the endocytic pathway after interaction with its surface receptor DAG1, followed by increasingly acidic conditions that would result in interaction with LAMP1 in the lysosomal membrane, triggering membrane fusion and release of the virus in the cytosol [48] .", "denotations": [{"id": "Virus_SARS-CoV-2", "phrase": "ncp", "start": 75, "end": 78}]}, {"text": "A boost of nearly 50 publications on alternative sampling within three years demonstrates the importance and documents the public health concern with this respiratory disease caused by a new Corona virus (CoV) (Additional file 1: Table S8 ).

The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc), providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. The ACE2-Fc therapy would also supplement decreased ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection, thereby directly treating acute respiratory distress pathophysiology as a third mechanism of action.

In the context of quality assurance and GMP compliance it is therefore also important to assess whether strains from different origins are robustly detectable, and the variation in susceptibility of detector cell lines must be taken into account when assessing the presence of ZIKV in biologicals. We therefore assessed the suitability of two cell lines, the human diploid MRC-5 and African green monkey Vero cell line, to detect ZIKV of African and Asian lineage. MRC-5 cells robustly and reproducibly detected single-digit levels of ZIKV MR766 whereas inoculation with ZIKV PE243 was detected on some, but not all, occasions. In order to assess the suitability of Vero cells to detect different lineages of ZIKV, we tested two subtypes of Vero cells that are currently in use in GMP testing laboratories. First, Vero (ATCC CCL-81), which were isolated from an African green monkey (Chlorocebus sp.) in 1962 and are referred to as 'the original Vero cells' [56] . Second, Vero C1008 (ATCC CRL-1586), which are a clone of Vero 76 (ATCC CRL-1587) isolated from Vero CCL-81 in 1968. Vero C1008 cells exhibit a slower growth rate in comparison to Vero CCL-81 and show some contact inhibition, and are thus suitable for the propagation and detection of slowly replicating viruses, or (Table 4 ). Our data show that that when testing for the presence of ZIKV in biologicals is required, Vero cells detect ZIKV contamination robustly and reproducibly with a suitable level of sensitivity. We acknowledge that other strains of ZIKV (e.g. from central Asia -Cambodia and Thailand) may show varying phenotypes during in vitro culture which may also depend on the innate competencies of the cell line in restricting viruses. However for the purposes of this work, two divergent strains representing the two major lineages have been selected. Vero cell lines are deficient in the synthesis of interferon alpha and beta (IFN a/b) -host immune defence molecules aimed at restricting viral replication, and a wide range of arthropod-borne viruses including strains of dengue types 1-4, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, Usutu [57, 58] and ZIKV [41] replicate and elicit CPE in Vero cells. Importantly, due to an ability to support replication of a wide range of flaviviruses, the Vero CCL-81 line is also recommended for virus stock production in the EU Horizon 2020-funded ZIKAlliance consortium [59] and used by the Public Health England National Collection of Pathogenic Viruses (NCPV) to generate authenticated stocks of ZIKV for supply [60] . The aim of the present study was to determine whether a generically validated assay (in vitro adventitious virus assay) is able to detect ZIKV that might be present in the raw materials and cell lines used for the production of biologicals. We demonstrated that this pathogen is robustly detectable by in vitro assay, thereby providing assurance of detection of ZIKV and in turn underpinning the robustness of in vitro virology assays in safety testing of biologicals. Importantly, the matrix of the product may be inhibitory to virus detection during the assay and consequently affect the sensitivity of the detection. Therefore one of the key assessments during biosafety testing for finished biologicals is to establish the level of effect, if any, of the test article matrix on a generally validated assay to detect contaminants. A study known as a Product Specific Qualification (PSQ) examines and quantitates the effect of representative batches of a defined production process on the performance of an assay. Matrices of bulk harvest that may be ostensibly similar may have quite different behaviour during in vitro assay, and PSQs address this.

PA-NcPROF has a PA tag sequence at its N-terminus ( Figure 1A) , whereas bx-PA-NcPROF has the signal sequence of bombyxin from B. mori at its N-terminus ( Figure 1B) . Meanwhile, bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM has the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of GP64 from BmNPV at the C-terminus of bx-PA-NcPROF ( Figure 1C ). The bombyxin signal peptide (bx) is responsible for the secretion of recombinant proteins to the hemolymph of silkworm larvae [17, 18] . The GP64TM were used as a fusion partner with NcPROF as a target protein to be incorporated into the cell membrane [19] . All NcPROF constructs were observed in both the fat body and hemolymph when they were expressed in silkworm larvae (Figure 2A ). PA-NcPROF, bx-PA-NcPROF, and bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM comprise 176, 195, and 226 amino acids, respectively, and their estimated molecular weights are 19, 21, and 25 kDa, respectively. All NcPROFs were expressed and verified intra-and extracellularly in Bm5 cells ( Figure 2B ). The molecular weight of PA-NcPROF was approximately 25 kDa by western blotting. The molecular weight of native NcPROF in this study was similar to that of full-length profilin expressed in E. coli (22 kDa) [12] . This finding suggests that PA-NcPROF expressed in silkworm larvae may be not modified posttranslationally. bx-PA-NcPROF was observed in the fat body and hemolymph at 25-30 kDa as a large obscure band that appeared as two bands. The molecular weight of the lower band was the same as that of PA-NcPROF and that of the upper band was larger than that of PA-NcPROF. This finding suggests that bx-PA-NcPROF may be partially modified posttranslationally after the cleavage of the bombyxin signal peptide. In fact, N128 was predicted as an N-glycosylation site estimated by NetNGlyc 1.0 Server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/). The bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM product was observed at 30-40 kDa by western blotting. Interestingly, bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was observed in the hemolymph and culture medium although it was fused with the transmembrane domain of GP64. In our previous report, N. caninum-derived antigens NcSAG1 and NcSRS2 fused with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of GP64 were not observed in hemolymph [9] . In this study, bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was secreted into hemolymph, in part, and the culture medium from Bm5 cells. It has been reported that profilins of T. gondii and Babesia canis were partially secreted even though no signal peptide is predicted in these genes [20, 21] . In this study, NcPROF was also secreted regardless of the addition of the signal sequence. To investigate N-glycosylation of the N-glycan of three NcPROFs, PNGase F treatment was carried out ( Figure S1 ). Molecular weight of each NcPROF was not changed between before and after the PNGase F treatment, indicating no N-glycan was attached into the three NcPROFs. These results suggest that the two bands of bx-PA-NcPROF did not come from its N-glycosylation. Hence, it showed that the bx-PA-NcPROF and bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM were not posttranslationally modified with an N-glycan in endoplasmic reticulum even though these proteins have the bx signal peptide. In addition, the discrepancy of the molecular weight of each PROF to its estimated that was not caused by the N-glycosylation. In nature, estimated pI of this NcPROF is around 4.89, which may have influence on the mobility of NcPROFs on the SDS-PAGE gel [22] . In addition, the negative charge of acidic residues may create repulsion and this repulsion caused the anomalous migration of protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gels [23] .

However, glycoproteins from some viruses are secreted and are partially incorporated into extracellular vesicles when they are overexpressed [24, 25] .

In our previous paper, antigens of N. caninum fused with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of BmGP64 were displayed on the surface of BmNPV particles, but few of these fusion proteins were secreted into silkworm hemolymph [9] . These studies suggest that the secretion of recombinant fusion proteins with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of BmGP64 depends on the properties of recombinant proteins of interest.

The growth of transport networks is a key factor in driving the speed and extent of disease spread. While air and shipping networks provide long distance connections, enabling rapid pathogen, host and vector movements 8-10 , the vast majority of shorter distance movements take place over land. This is particularly true in low income settings, where poorer populations are disproportionately affected by infectious diseases and air travel often remains the preserve of wealthier people. Evidence of the importance of regional connectivity through road networks on infectious disease spread is growing 11-14 .

Six human coronaviruses that have been identified to date (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL-63, HCoV-HUK-1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV). Two out of them emerged in the past 15 years (Lau & Chan, 2015) , namely, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). SARS-CoV emerged in 2003 in China and spread to many countries throughout the world (Peiris et al., 2003) . Approximately 8,000 people were infected, and 10% of them died (Aronin & Sadigh, 2004) . Only 9 years later, MERS-CoV emerged in Saudi Arabia (Zaki et al., 2012) . This is a relatively short period for the emergence of a new coronavirus. One of the main reasons behind the rapid emergence of new coronaviruses is the poor proofreading capability of their RNA polymerases (Hofer, 2013) . This is in addition to the possibility of the recombination of different coronaviruses (Makino et al., 1986) , and it will not be surprising if new coronaviruses emerge in the near future. MERS-CoV continues to pose great challenges to the healthcare system of some countries in the Middle East and Arabian Peninsula. Since its discovery late in 2012 (Zaki et al., 2012) , there are ongoing reports to the World Health Organization (WHO) from some countries in the Middle East, especially the Arabian Peninsula, with spread to other countries around the globe. According to the latest WHO statistics, there have been a total of 2,428 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including at least 838 deaths (reported case fatality rate of 35.0%) (WHO, 2018) . The continuous ongoing reports on MERS-CoV suggesting the presence of some factors favor its sustainability in certain regions. There are many uncertain aspects of the virus evolution, pathogenesis, and transmission cycle. Unfortunately, recently, there was some decline in the rate of research on the virus from different aspects (Hemida et al., 2017b) .

Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain (ACE2-Fc), providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. The ACE2-Fc therapy would also supplement decreased ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection, thereby directly treating acute respiratory distress pathophysiology as a third mechanism of action. The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken.

Seven years later, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019 reproduced this pattern of disproportionate fear of importation and spread of infections in mainland France while the cases reported worldwide remain almost only localised in China as only 34 people died of this disease (Covid-19) outside China as at 25 February 2020 [3] .", "denotations": [{"id": "Disease_COVID-19", "phrase": "novel coronavirus", "start": 130, "end": 147}, {"id": "Disease_COVID-19", "phrase": "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2", "start": 169, "end": 216}]}, {"text": "In order to evaluate the virus-specific CD8 T cell response, we stimulated cells isolated from the lung with the D k -restricted N421-428 epitope [21] .

SARScoronavirus (SARS-CoV), a novel coronavirus classified as a member of the Coronaviridae family was soon identified as the causative pathogen [3, 4] . The RNA genome of SARS-CoV consists of 14 potential major open reading frames that encode the viral non-structural proteins, accesory proteins, and structural proteins including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [5] . Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the type I integral transmembrane protein, was identified to be the functional receptor for SARS-CoV both in vitro [5, 6] and in vivo [7] . Studies on the expression of ACE2 protein and the tissue tropism and cellular distributions of SARS-CoV provided new insight into the mechanism of pathogenesis [8] . Nevertheless, certain ACE2-expressing endothelial cells and human intestinal cell lines failed to be infected by SARS-CoV [9, 10] . In contrast, cells without a detectable expression level of ACE2 such as hepatocytes could be infected by SARS-CoV [8] . In addition, the presence of ACE2 alone is not sufficient for maintaining viral infection [8] . Altogether, these observations indicate that different virus receptors or co-receptors may be utilized in the infection of SARS-CoV in various tissues. Indeed, DC-SIGN, a c-type lectin receptor expressed on dendritic cells, and a DC-SIGN-related molecule, L-SIGN (also named DC-SIGNR and CD209L) have been indicated to interact with the SARS-CoV spike protein and to facilitate the virus dissemination [11, 12] .", "denotations": [{"id": "Disease_COVID-19", "phrase": "novel coronavirus", "start": 459, "end": 476}]}, {"text": "Scientists then isolated a novel coronavirus from human airway epithelial cells, which was named 2019-nCoV 5 .

This, among other coronaviruses, namely human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV predominantly cause respiratory disease [1, 9, 10] . Human coronavirus NL63 has a worldwide distribution and is known to be associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract infections in both adults and children with seroconversion occurring at a very early age [11, 12] . Most of the known human coronaviruses are believed to have originated from mammalian reservoirs such as bats and used other mammalian hosts as intermediate hosts before ending up in the human population. Some of these, like HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV, used camelid species [13] [14] [15] [16] , while SARS-CoV went through Himalayan palm civets as intermediate hosts [17, 18] . Further, HCoV-OC43 is reported to have originated directly from cattle [19] . Unlike these groups of coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have no known intermediate mammalian hosts. Human coronavirus NL63 is known to use the same receptor as SARS-CoV [20] , and may therefore, like some SARS-CoV-related viruses, be capable of infecting swine [21] . This assertion is, however, yet to be explored through surveillance data. Different serological studies have mainly employed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) approaches for investigating HCoV-NL63 [22] [23] [24] [25] . Most of these assays are designed for specific purposes ranging from seroprevalence studies to studies of the HCoV-NL63 genome [12, 26] , and would therefore vary in parameters like sensitivity and specificity. There is no single assay that is widely accepted as the standard for serological detection of HCoV-NL63, and this presents a challenge in the general validation of new assays. Coronaviruses have the potential to recombine to produce new viruses [27] , and as such, knowledge of potential hosts other than humans that can be infected by two human coronaviruses is important to provide information on potential sources of novel human coronaviruses that may later spillover into human populations and cause disease. Knowledge of potential intermediate hosts of human coronaviruses will also provide information on the evolution of coronaviruses in general and interspecies transmission events that lead to emergence. The purpose of this study was therefore to assess the potential of domestic livestock species as intermediate hosts for HCoV-NL63.", "denotations": [{"id": "Disease_COVID-19", "phrase": "novel coronavirus", "start": 266, "end": 283}]}, {"text": "Coronaviruses have been shown to have the potential to mutate and genetically recombine when two viruses infect the same cell [59] , as seen for instance with recombination events between canine coronavirus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus and canine coronavirus and feline coronaviruses that have brought about new coronaviruses [60, 61] . These new viruses may have a different host range particularly if changes occur in the spike region or different pathology in the same host and as such knowing the possible intermediate hosts of coronaviruses that infect humans is important as these provide information on the evolution of the virus as well as possible mixing vessels for these viruses.

However, little is known about the architectures or mechanisms of T4SSs in Gram-positives (Alvarez-Martinez and Christie, 2009) . Although T4SS-mediated mobilization of genetic elements has been characterized in some species of Gram-positive bacteria, such elements are currently limited to conjugative plasmids (e.g. E. faecalis pCF10, S. agalactiae pIP501 and C. perfringens pCW3) and transposons (e.g. E. faecalis Tn916, B. subtilis ICEBs1 and S. agalactiae TnGBS2).

In the 4 decades since Nixon's war on cancer, there has been tremendous progress in our understanding of cancer, including the discovery of oncogenes, cellular growth factors, and mutations associated with carcinogenesis. Although cancer remains a major killer throughout the world, the death rates for a number of major cancers, including gastric, breast, uterine, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer, are actually declining (16) , while average survival times have improved. Even if a cure is not forthcoming, the risk of shooting for the Moon is low. Earlier moonshots have produced benefits that could not possibly have been envisaged when the projects began. The Manhattan Project generated a vast amount of spin-off information that found its way into civilian nuclear power, radioisotopes for medical use, and plutonium-based batteries for exploratory spacecraft. The space program of the 1960s improved weather forecasting through satellite observation and greatly enhanced telecommunication, and it gave us the global positioning system that empowers our cell phones. Successes in HIV treatment showed that it was possible to effectively treat chronic viral infections, and today the same technology is being applied to many different viruses, some of which cause cancer.

This phenomenon did not occur for doxorubicin alone. Similarly, a combination therapy with paclitaxel (25 mg/kg) and pSINCP/neu was ineffective. Moreover, VEE-neu particles were subcutaneously administered in a rat mammary tumor model, which resulted in the elimination of 36% of pre-existing aggressive mammary tumors [84] . The combination of dendritic cell (DC)-based cancer immunotherapy with VEE-neu particle administration induced both cellular and humoral immunity against neu in transgenic human breast tumor-bearing mice [85] . Moreover, this treatment resulted in the significant inhibition of tumor growth. Similarly, both tumor growth and pulmonary metastatic spread were significantly inhibited when mice with pre-existing tumors were subjected to five immunizations with SFV10-E VLP expressing the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) [93] . Furthermore, co-immunization with SFV particles encoding VEGFR-2 and IL-4 generated significant tumor regression in mice.", "denotations": [{"id": "Virus_SARS-CoV-2", "phrase": "ncp", "start": 713, "end": 716}]}, {"text": "Emerging novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-current scenario, evolutionary perspective based on genome analysis and recent developments", "denotations": [{"id": "Disease_COVID-19", "phrase": "novel coronavirus", "start": 9, "end": 26}]}, {"text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are well-known causes of severe infections, respiratory, enteric and systemic, in humans and numerous animal hosts.

The coronaviruses of relevant veterinary species are shown in Table 1 with organ affected and clinical signs. Though human CoVs were identified for the first time in the year 1960 from respiratory infections in adults as well as children, the major scientific interest in CoVs research grew only after the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in the year 2002 (Drosten et al. 2003 Ksiazek et al. 2003; Peiris et al. 2003) . In this SARS-CoV epidemic, around 8000 confirmed human cases with 774 deaths (around 9.5% mortality rate) occurred that was a result of its global spread (Kahn and McIntosh 2005) . Initially, the virus was detected in the caged Himalayan palm civets and these were thought to be the natural host of this virus . Following SARS-CoV incidence in 2003, a similar CoV named HKU3-1 to HKU3-3 were identified in the horseshoe bats (non-caged) in 2005 from Hong Kong (Lau et al. 2005) . Since then, bats are considered to be the natural host and potential reservoir species that could be held responsible for any future CoVs epidemics and/or pandemics (Cui et al. 2019 . After the 2003 and 2005 SARS-CoV epidemics, an analogous virus emerged in the Middle East region of the world leading to severe respiratory illness and was named the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) (Zaki et al. 2012 ). The mortality was higher than previous SARS-CoV pandemic claiming around 919 lives out of the total 2521 human cases (around 35% mortality) (World Health Organization 2015) . Notably, dromedary camels were connected with the transmission of MERS-CoV (Alagaili et al. 2014) . Further, its origin was also traced from bats (Ithete et al. 2013 ). All these highly pathogenic human CoVs, SARS and MERS, show emergence over wider areas of the world posing high risk of human-to-human transmission and fatal consequences thereto (Figure 1 ). This decade's first CoV emergency was from Hubei province of China, and as on February 4, 2020, 425 deaths have been reported in China only (World Health Organization 2020b). Further, the spread of this novel coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, has been noted in 24 countries till date.

Some cases showed rapid development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) followed by serious complications in the respiratory tract.

The diversity of CoVs in the bat population needs further investigation in details, as well as the surveillance and monitoring of bats becomes critical to prevent future outbreaks in animals and the public. The recent nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses. Successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better diagnostics and effective vaccines. A report emerged from China where the scientists claimed successful isolation of the 2019-nCoV virus in Vero and Huh7 cell lines from infected patients. Subsequently, in aiding the further research for designing rapid diagnostics and vaccine development for nCoV, scientists at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at Melbourne, Australia, were also successful in growing the Wuhan coronavirus in cell culture.

After July 2003, only a few community and laboratory-acquired cases have been reported (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/). Nevertheless, coronaviruses, including those similar to the strain that caused the epidemic, are widely disseminated in bats circulating all over the world, making a future outbreak possible [2] [3] [4] [5] .

SARS-CoV envelope (E) protein is a small integral membrane protein of 76 amino acids that contains a short hydrophilic amino-terminus followed by a hydrophobic region, and a hydrophilic carboxy-terminus [10] . The hydrophobic region forms at least one amphipathic a-helix that oligomerizes to form an ion-conductive pore in membranes [11] [12] [13] . E protein is present within virions in very small amounts, however it is abundant in the infected cells [14] , and it is mainly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment (ER-GIC), where it actively participates in virus budding, morphogenesis and trafficking [15] [16] [17] . Interestingly, SARS-CoV lacking the E protein was attenuated in different animal models, such as hamsters, transgenic mice that expressed the SARS-CoV receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2), and conventional mice using a mouse adapted SARS-CoV [18] [19] [20] [21] , indicating that SARS-CoV E gene may be a virulence factor.

A report from a recent workshop in Riyadh on countermeasures for MERS CoV bringing together funders, public health experts and researchers concluded that progress with vaccine development is still hindered by the lack of animal models for evaluating efficacy. 100 Small animals do not naturally express a functional form of the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor; however, transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 are susceptible to infection. 101, 102 Despite this advance, mouse models are likely to be less useful for the assessment of immune correlates than larger animal models such as rhesus macaques and common marmosets, which exhibit the severe clinical syndromes observed in humans. 103, 104 MVA and ChAd viral vectors for MERS have reached GMP manufacture, while a DNA vaccine is now being tested in clinical trials. 105, 106 Progress with development of chimpanzee adenovirus vectors for outbreak pathogens In May 2017, the first cases in an outbreak of EVD were reported in the Bas Uele Province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). 107 This area shares a border with the Central African Republic and is particularly remote and difficult to access. As the causative species has been identified as Zaire ebolavirus, the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine is being considered at the time of writing, for deployment in a ring vaccination design to protect contacts and frontline healthcare workers (HCWs). 108 This fresh outbreak is the 8 th to occur in the DRC and highlights the potential utility of vaccination to protect HCWs, particularly where remote locations present significant logistical challenges for responding to and containing outbreaks. Maintaining the current momentum for developing vaccines against outbreak pathogens is crucial, and as such, simian adenoviruses are uniquely fit for purpose as an effective vaccine platform, not in small part due to their predictable safety profile, stability, manufacturability, but most importantly owing to their immunogenicity.

Despite the fact that such modification occurs in histone proteins, current approaches to map and visualize such information are limited to sequence coordinates in the genome. Our physical genome model visualizes methylation of histone proteins at atomic detail as determined by crystal structure.

However, later, wide-reaching investigations of farmed and wild-caught civets revealed that the SARS-CoV strains found in market civets were transmitted to them by other animals 16, 39 . In 2005, two teams independently reported the discovery of novel coronaviruses related to human SARS-CoV, which were named SARS-CoV-related viruses or SARS-like coronaviruses, in horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) 15, 43 . These discoveries suggested that bats may be the natural hosts for SARS-CoV and that civets were only intermediate hosts. Subsequently, many coronaviruses phylogenetically related to SARS-CoV (SARSr-CoVs) were discovered in bats from different provinces in China and also from European, African and Southeast Asian countries 15, 20, 38, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] (FIg. 4;  Supplementary Fig. S1a ). According to the ICTV criteria, only the strains found in Rhinolophus bats in European countries, Southeast Asian countries and China are SARSr-CoV variants. Those from Hipposideros bats in Africa are less closely related to SARS-CoV and should be classified as a new coronavirus species 54 . These data indicate that SARSr-CoVs have wide geographical spread and might have been prevalent in bats for a very long time. A 5-year longitudinal study revealed the coexistence of highly diverse SARSr-CoVs in bat populations in one cave of Yunnan province, China 18, 20, 55 . This location is a diversity hot spot, and the SARSr-CoVs in this location contain all the genetic diversity found in other locations of China. Furthermore, the viral strains that exist in this one location contain all genetic elements that are needed to form SARS-CoV (FIg. 5) . As no direct progenitor of SARS-CoV was found in bat populations despite 15 years of searching and as RNA recombination is frequent within coronaviruses 56 , it is highly likely that SARS-CoV newly emerged through recombination of Coronaviruses form enveloped and spherical particles of 100-160 nm in diameter.

The viral genomes from early-phase patients contain two genotypes of orf8, one with a complete orf8 (369 nucleo tides) and the other containing an 82-nucleotide deletion. By contrast, viral genomes from late-phase patients and most of the genomes from middle-phase patients contain a split orf8 (orf8a and orf8b) owing to a 29-nucleotide deletion; two exceptions were found in middle-phase genomes, one containing an 82-nucleotide deletion in orf8 and the other with the whole orf8 deleted.

Generation of VSV-G mutants A133R and LXXXL was achieved by the same strategy using the expression plasmid for wt VSV-G as a template. The expression plasmid for human tetherin was generated by amplifying the ORF from a previously described plasmid [34] and inserting it into plasmid pCAGGS using KpnI and XhoI restriction sites.

Within the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera, nine of the 18 recognised viral species have been identified in bats [125] . Moreover, two high profile human disease outbreaks, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have been phylogenetically linked to a zoonotic viral origin in bats [126, 127] . Most coronaviruses are associated with insectivorous bats (Rhinolophus sinicus, Rhinolophus macrotis, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Chaerephon plicata, Rhinolophus pusillus, Rhinolophus blasii, Tylonycteris pachypus, Pipistrellus abramus, Neoromica capensis, Vespertilio superans) [126] . Bat-to-human transmission of coronaviruses is likely very rare, if it occurs at all, and it is more common for bats to infect another terrestrial animal which subsequently infects humans. After the discovery and characterisation of SARS-CoV circulating in masked palm civets sold at Chinese markets and then later in horseshoe bat populations (Rhinolophus) in China, it was suggested that bats were the primary reservoir and the civet infection was a result of a spill over event [128] [129] [130] [131] [132] . In addition to this, the initial detection of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia suggested that camelids may be a reservoir host for this pathogen but subsequent studies have reported a single isolation from fecal matter from a Taphozous perforates bat and a \u03b2-coronavirus, with 96.5% amino acid identity to the MERS-CoV, has been isolated from a Nyctinomops laticaudatus bat [127, 133] . This warrants the speculation that either the MERS-CoV reservoir resides in a bat species and remains to be discovered, or that dromedary camels are the primary reservoir for MERS-CoV that originated following cross species transmission of a viral ancestor that once resided in a bat populations. The coronvirus surface-located trimeric spike glycoprotein (S) dictates the coronavirus host range as it specifically binds certain receptors for infection [134, 135] and so studies surrounding receptor utilisation are warranted in determining any host restriction for these viruses. Rhinolophid bats in China have been described as hosts to many SARS-like coronaviruses, some of which are proposed to be the direct ancestors of SARS-CoV [136] . Each of these pathogens has the potential to cross the species barrier and cause disease outbreaks in terrestrial species, a process though to be driven by adaptation to the new host through genetic mutation [137] . Whilst many of the exact mechanisms required for a spill over event to occur are largely undefined, the S protein and host receptors are the logical starting point and key binding sites of the S protein and potential host receptors remain to be characterised for multiple pathogens. Certainly, identification of receptor binding domains may reveal host tropism patterns and enable evaluation of virus spill over potential.", "denotations": [{"id": "Disease_COVID-19", "phrase": "novel coronavirus", "start": 482, "end": 499}]}, {"text": "Enveloped animal viruses also use a two-step process to release their genetic material into the cell: first they bind to specific cell-surface receptors anchored to the target cell membrane and then they induce fusion of the viral and cell membranes. Binding to the cell-surface receptor in these viruses is mediated by a viral glycoprotein embedded in the viral lipid envelope which specifically interacts with some cellular molecule, which typically is a membrane-associated glycoprotein, carbohydrate or glycolipid. Detailed knowledge of virus-receptor interactions is essential to understand different aspects that determine viral tropism, spread and pathogenesis. During the last few years, a large number of high-resolution structures of viral proteins in complex with their specific receptors have been reported, shedding light on these aspects. Very recently, Wang and co-workers characterized the interactions between the newly identified Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and its target cell by solving the structure of the receptor-binding domain of the viral envelope spike glycoprotein bound to its cellular receptor, the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 .

Viruses are the leading cause of ARIs, accounting for up to 80% of all cases [4, 5] . Increased use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) over the past decade has led to a greater detection of previously underrecognized viruses such as human coronaviruses (HCoVs). HCoVs have been detected worldwide from persons of all ages [6] . HCoVs are commonly associated with upper respiratory tract infections, cause up to one-third of all common colds [7, 8] , and can also cause severe lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, in susceptible individuals [9] [10] [11] . There are 4 genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronaviruses. In the genus Alphacoronavirus, there are several species including HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63. In the genus Betacoronavirus, species include HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were first identified in the mid-1960s, with HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 reported in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The 4 non-SARS/MERS species circulate widely in humans, whereas SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are thought to spread in animal reservoirs, occasionally spilling over to human populations [6] . The SARS outbreak of 2002-2003 was caused by SARS-CoV, a novel coronavirus. This worldwide outbreak brought attention to this family of viruses; the discovery of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 followed shortly thereafter. The subsequent outbreak of MERS-CoV beginning in 2012 led to a renewed interest in HCoVs and their potential severity.

Applying the principles of infection control brought the epidemic under control but a concern for reemergence naturally or a deliberate release supported continuation of a vaccine development effort so as to have the knowledge and capability necessary for preparing and using an effective vaccine should a need arise. For this purpose, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases supported preparation of vaccines for evaluation for potential use in humans. This effort was hampered by the occurrence in the initial preclinical trial of an immunopathogenictype lung disease among ferrets and Cynomolgus monkeys given a whole virus vaccine adjuvanted with alum and challenged with infectious SARS-CoV [14] .

Collectrin was first identified as an unknown protein upregulated in a model of partial nephrectomy, its function remaining elusive for four years until crystals of tyrosine and phenylalanine were detected in the urine of collectrin-null mice [74] . Further investigation revealed that the levels of the neutral amino acid transporter, B 0 AT1, which reached the plasma membrane were significantly decreased in collectrin-null mice [75] . This suggested that collectrin may act as a molecular chaperone for B 0 AT1 in the kidney, implicating ACE2 in a similar role, because of their close homology. An elegant set of studies subsequently revealed that ACE2 did in fact act as the molecular chaperone for B 0 AT1 in the small intestine, where collectrin is not expressed. This interaction was shown to underlie the pathology of the aminoaciduria seen in Hartnup disorder. Hartnup disorder is caused by a mutation on the outer edge of B 0 AT1 resulting in its failure to reach the plasma membrane [76] .

These methods are useful for detecting novel coronaviruses not only in humans, but also in animals for identification of animal reservoir or intermediate host of 2019-nCoV. WHO recommended that if there is no clue about the putative pathogen from the pneumonia outbreak, a pan-coronavirus assay should be used for amplification followed by sequencing of the amplicon for characterization and confirmation (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/ handle/10665/330374/WHO-2019-nCoV-laboratory-2020.1-eng.pdf). By aligning 2019-nCoV S protein sequence with those of SARS-CoV and several bat-SL-CoVs, we predicted that the cleavage site for generating S1 and S2 subunits is located at R694/S695 ( Figure 1 ). S1 subunit contains two functional domains, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and a receptor-binding domain (RBD), both of which are responsible for the binding of the virion to the receptor on the host cell. They also contain several conformational neutralizing epitopes, serving as a target for developing neutralizing antibodies and vaccines [5] . S2 subunit contains three functional domains, fusion peptide (FP), and heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2. After binding of RBD in S1 to the receptor, the S2 subunit changes conformation by inserting the FP into the host cell membrane and association between HR1 and HR2 to form six-helical bundle (6-HB), resulting in the fusion between viral and cellular membranes. The viral genetic materials enter into the host cell through the fusion pore for replication in the cell [5] . A peptide derived from the HR2 domain of SARS-CoV S protein (SC-1) can interact with HR1 region in viral S protein to form heterologous 6-HB, resulting in the inhibition of homologous 6-HB formation between HR1 and HR2 domains in viral S protein and thus blocking the viral fusion with the host cell [6] . Since 2019-nCoV S-HR2 sequence is 100% identical to that of SARS-CoV, while there are only a few mutations of non-critical amino acids in S-HR1 region, SC-1 peptide is expected to be also effective against 2019-nCoV infection.", "denotations": [{"id": "Disease_COVID-19", "phrase": "novel coronavirus", "start": 33, "end": 50}]}, {"text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in September 2012 as a novel coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory disease. 1 Since then, this virus has caused recurrent outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula and has spread, occasionally, to other parts of the world.

The 5\u2032 most two-thirds of MERS-CoV genome encodes polyproteins 1a and 1ab, which are further cleaved to yield 16 non-structural proteins, whereas the 3\u2032 end of the genome encodes several structural or lineage-specific proteins. 13 Upon infection, these proteins are expressed to facilitate viral replication and propagation in the host. 14 MERS-CoV infection has been widely reported to mildly induce type I interferons (IFNs), including IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2, in patients as well as in animal and cellular infection models. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] This has been attributed to the IFNantagonizing property of some MERS-CoV-encoded proteins, which directly perturb the host IFN production mechanisms, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] lending support to the notion that MERS-CoV uses multiple strategies to evade the innate immune response.", "denotations": [{"id": "Disease_COVID-19", "phrase": "novel coronavirus", "start": 116, "end": 133}]}, {"text": "Patients with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV), developed mild to fatal pulmonary disease, with a mortality incidence of 10% [17] .

Virus could be detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate and feces for as long as 21 days after disease onset [19, 21] . Delayed virus clearance may have resulted from suboptimal T and B cell responses; suboptimal neutralizing antibody responses are detected in patients with severe disease [17, 18, 19, 20] . Numerous studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV infection fails to activate macrophages and dendritic cells. Although these cells can be infected, they are functionally impaired: antiviral cytokines such as type I interferon were not expressed and endocytic capacity (antigen capture) was compromised ( [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28] and reviewed in [29] ). These unusual findings raised the possibility that initial infection with the virus resulted in delayed or suboptimal activation of the innate immune system.

Specifically, BALB/c mice infected with mouseadapted SARS-CoV develop severe respiratory disease. Here, we show that the T cell response is defective in these mice and that this results from inefficient activation of the initial immune response to the virus. This defect can be corrected by several treatments, including depletion of inhibitory macrophages from the lungs and direct activation of respiratory dendritic cells, important in initiating the immune response or transfer of activated dendritic cells prior to infection. All of these modalities result in improved initiation of the immune response and an enhanced anti-virus T cell response.

Though at first it was thought that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are structurally similar and tried to treat MERS-CoV infected patient with the SASR-CoV treatment.

These viruses are actually zoonotic origin, undergo recombination, and may be in future another strain of this group of virus will come [37] . Therefore, it is important to take preventing measures not only to prevent this new strain of coronavirus, also against all the strain of coronavirus. There is no recommended vaccine for coronaviruses which is necessary to prevent. Most of the cases, vaccines were designed by targeting spike protein. Similarly, researchers also reported to design vaccine against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spike protein [38, 39] . Fernando et al. also designed lived-attenuated MERS coronavirus by mutating MERS-CoV envelope protein as a vaccine which will be for only MERS-CoV [40] . These vaccines would thus be effective for only those strains not for others. Giving a universal vaccine for all strain of viruses is much more promising solution rather than giving individual vaccine for individual strain. The concept of prevention of viruses by designing a universal vaccine has also been reported previously, for example against Influenza virus. In case of influenza virus, universal vaccine against matrix 2 protein which was found to be conserved among all Influenza subtypes was reported [41] .

MHV TRS binds across the \u03b2-platform of NTD in a defined orientation, with the 5'-end of TRS near \u03b24 and the 3'-end of TRS near \u03b25; this N219 binding to single-stranded RNAs-containing the TRS or cTRS-uses base stacking interactions between aromatic side chains on the \u03b2-platform with a triple adenosine motif within the TRS, 5'-gAAUCUAAACU-3' [26] . Furthermore, due to its potent helix-destabilizing activity, N219 is able to efficiently melt an RNA duplex between the template TRS and nascent cTRS strand into component single strands that may be transiently formed during discontinuous transcription of viral sgRNA by the coronaviral replicase complex [26] . Three residues on the \u03b2-platform have been shown to play key roles in TRS binding and helix destabilization: Arg-125 and Tyr-127 on the \u03b23 strand and Tyr-190 on the \u03b25 strand, suggesting that the AAA motif in the 3'-end of the TRS is anchored here [18] . These three residues are completely invariant in betacoronavirus N proteins and occupy precisely analogous positions on the fold of each NTD, and are therefore likely to define similar RNA binding grooves in the closely related SARS NTD [18] . The duplex formation and duplex TRS unwinding activity exhibited by N219 therefore implicates MHV NTD in template switching during discontinuous sgRNA transcription [28, 29] . Moreover, the ability of the NTD to melt dsRNA may also play a role in RNA packaging or other steps in the viral life cycle where RNA remodeling is needed [26] . For example, mutations that cripple duplex unwinding are defective in stimulating CoV replication in BHK-R cells, and are lethal, providing evidence of a critical role for NTD in viral replication [18, 26] . CoV N proteins have also been recognized as RNA chaperones [30, 31] , which, as part of their chaperone activities, anneal nucleic acids, and so RNA duplex destabilization activity may be important in CoV N NTDs role in assisting viral RNA in reaching its functional three-dimentional structure.

Coronaviruses are enveloped, positivestranded RNA viruses of mammals and birds. These viruses have high mutation and gene recombination rates, making them ideal for pathogen evolution. 1 In humans, coronavirus is usually associated with mild disease, the common cold. Previous emerging novel coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which emerged in the Middle East in 2012, were associated with severe and sometimes fatal disease. MERS-CoV was less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, with the most severe infections mainly in individuals with underlying illnesses. Clinically and epidemiologically, the contemporary 2019-nCoV in China seems to resemble SARS-CoV. The genome of 2019-nCoV also appears most closely related to SARS-CoV and related bat coronaviruses. 2 The infection has now spread widely, with phylogenetic analysis of the emerging viruses suggesting an initial single-locus zoonotic spillover event in November, 2019, 3 There is an increasing focus on the human-animalenvironment disease interface, as encompassed in the One Health concept. Mortalities, disability-adjusted life-years, and billions of dollars of economic losses from these infections demand action and investment in prevention to face novel challenges to human and animal health. Research has led to better understanding of the nature and drivers of cross-species viral jumps, but the detail is still elusive. No reservoir population of bats for SARS and MERS-CoV or Ebola virus have been definitively identified, despite considerable searching, possibly because of the source virus circulating in small and isolated populations. Forensic examination has clarified the human infection sources and multispecies involvement in these diseases, with some species confirmed as competent hosts (eg, camels for MERS-CoV 4 ), bridge (or amplifying) hosts (eg, pigs for Nipah virus, non-human primates for Ebola virus 5 ), or deadend hosts. The crucial checkpoint is the jump and bridging of the viruses to humans, which occurs most frequently through animal-based food systems. In the case of SARS, markets with live and dead animals of wild and domestic origins were the crucible for virus evolution and emergence in the human population. Once the viruses' functional proteins enabled cell entry in civets (Paguma larvata) and racoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), the bridge was established and it was only a matter of time before the jump to humans occurred. 6 Sequence comparison of civet viruses suggested evolution was ongoing; this was further supported by high seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV among civet sellers, suggesting previous cross-species transmission events without necessarily human-tohuman transmission. 7, 8 Similarly, early Ebola virus was mostly associated with bushmeat and its consumption in Africa; Nipah virus is associated with date palm sap, fruit, and domestic pig farms; MERS is associated with the camel livestock industry; and H5N1 arose from viral evolution in domestic and wild birds, to ultimately bring all these cases to humans.

Coronaviruses have a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome and are classified into four genera of alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltacoronaviruses [1] . Coronaviruses are prone to mutation and recombination during replication and this propensity has contributed to the existing diversity of coronaviruses [2, 3] . Sudden emergence of new coronaviruses transmitted from animal hosts, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and, more recently, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has raised awareness about the potential risks of highly virulent coronavirus infections in humans with increasing close contact between humans and animals harboring coronaviruses. However, effective therapeutic measures for coronavirus infections have been elusive so far despite the extensive efforts in the development of anti-coronavirus agents [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Shifts in tissue or cell tropism and resulting changes in virulence have also been reported for coronaviruses; porcine respiratory coronavirus causes mild respiratory infection in pigs and presumably arose from transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), the etiologic agent of gastroenteritis in young pigs with a high fatality, by spontaneous mutations and/or deletions in its genome [9] . Seemingly innocuous coronavirus infection can also be turned deadly by changing its tropism, exemplified by mutation of feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) to feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) [10, 11] . Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) has intrigued researchers for half a century since its first description in the 1960s [10] . Infection with FECV which causes inapparent or mild enteritis is widespread among cats, especially in high-density environments, and has little clinical consequence. However, a small portion of cats develop FIP during the course of FECV infection and succumb to the disease. Published studies support that FIP arises in individual cats through mutation of the virus to gain tropism for macrophages [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] and that the immune system of the infected cats plays an important role in the pathogenesis of FIP [11] . FIP occurs in two major forms, effusive (wet) form or non-effusive (dry) form. The wet form is more common (60-70% of FIP cases) and characterized by accumulation of fluids in the abdominal and/or, to a lesser degree, chest cavities [11] . Granulomatous vasculitis is frequently found in the omentum, mesenteric lymph nodes, and serosal surface of the large intestine, resulting in the characteristic exudates rich in protein and inflammatory cells in the body cavities in wet FIP [11] . The majority of exudate cells are virusinfected macrophages and high virus load is detected in these cells [17] . Multiple granulomatous lesions composed of macrophages laden with viruses and other inflammatory cells typically form in various tissues and organs, such as the omentum, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and liver, in both forms of FIP [17] . Clinical symptoms of FIP reflect the organs involved and include fever, jaundice, bodily effusions and weight loss and may also affect the central nervous system and the eyes [11] .", "denotations": [{"id": "Disease_COVID-19", "phrase": "new coronavirus", "start": 483, "end": 498}]}, {"text": "Two months after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the possibility of established and widespread community transmission in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) is becoming more likely.

In addition, a novel coronavirus had earlier been identified and characterized with this method in the same bird species [9] , and it is likely that other animal species, including humans, may carry not yet identified s2m harbouring viruses. Several of the viruses carrying s2m are important animal pathogens, and the conserved nature of the motif might make it an adequate target for antivirals. s2m has so far only been identified in viruses with a poly(A)tailed genome, and always located within 200 nucleotides from the poly(A) tail. In the novel pigeon astroviruses, s2m was located entirely within the 39 UTR ( Figure 5 ), similarly to the location of s2m in all avastroviruses, except for Duck astrovirus (DAstV), where s2m is partially located in the capsid region and partially in the 39 UTR, as in mamastrorviruses. S2m in picorna-and coronaviruses is located entirely within the 39 UTR, while s2m in norovirus is located partially in the minor capsid complex (ORF3) and partially in the 39 UTR. The invariant positioning of s2m close to the 39 end of the positive RNA strand may suggest that its function is connected to the replication or the stability of the viral RNA molecule. The wide range of viruses harbouring s2m suggests that its function is not by interaction with virus proteins. Even considering the wide range of host cell types, it might have a function based on interaction with conserved cellular biomolecules. The viruses harbouring s2m have different strategies for translation initiation, but a role of s2m in viral RNA translation through binding to one or more proteins possessing an oligomerbinding-like fold has been proposed based on tertiary structural comparisons [17] . Three lines of evidence suggest that a mechanism for facilitation of its horizontal transfer is imbedded in the structure itself: 1) the relative high number of recombination or excision events necessary to explain its distribution among virus groups, 2) the wide range of RNA primary and secondary structures surrounding the motif and 3) that the excision or insertion of s2m seem to be restricted to the structure without surrounding sequences.", "denotations": [{"id": "Disease_COVID-19", "phrase": "novel coronavirus", "start": 120, "end": 137}]}, {"text": "Epidemiology and Infection Passengers' destinations from China: low risk of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) transmission into Africa and South America", "denotations": [{"id": "Disease_COVID-19", "phrase": "novel coronavirus", "start": 76, "end": 93}]}, {"text": "On 31 December 2019, local hospitals in Wuhan, China reported that they had detected a series of cases of Novel Coronavirus-infected pneumonia to the World Health Organization (WHO) [1] .

A pair of PCR primers was designed to amplify the intervening sequences between the two conserved regions, and a fragment that possessed 89% identity over 37 amino acids to MHV, a murine coronavirus, was obtained ( Figure 1 ; sequence available as Data S1, found at http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/ journal.pbio.0000002.sd001.).

This procedure took advantage of the physical separation achieved during microarray hybridization, which effectively purified the viral nucleic acid from other nucleic acid species present in the sample. Using a tungsten needle, the DNA microarray spot corresponding to the conserved 39 UTR motif was repeatedly scraped and the hybridized nucleic acid was recovered. This material was subsequently amplified, cloned, and sequenced ( Figure 2 ). The largest clone spanned almost 1.1 kb; this fragment encompassed the 39 UTR conserved motif and extended into the most 39 coding region of the viral genome. BLAST analysis revealed 33% identity over 157 amino acids to MHV nucleocapsid, thus confirming the presence of a novel coronavirus (see Figure 1 ; see Data S1).

As analysis of the SARS-CoV genetic sequence revealed large differences to any other currently known coronaviruses in humans or domestic animals [16, 17] , it was hypothesized that the new virus might originate from wild animals. This hypothesis was supported by a search for coronaviruses in wild animals sold on markets in southern China, which identified the presence of a coronavirus in civet cats. This animal coronavirus was shown to have a sequence identity of more than 99% to the SARS coronavirus [18] with only a limited number of deletions and mutations between both viruses. SARS-CoV has a deletion of 29 nucleotides relative to the civet cat virus, indicating that if there was direct transmission, it went from the animal to man, because deletions occur probably more easily than insertions. Recent reports indicate that SARS-CoV is distinct from the civet cat virus and it has not been answered so far if the civet cat virus is the origin of the SARS-CoV or if civet cats were also infected from other species [19] . Therefore, there are no data available on the possibility of horizontal transmission between animals, and the question whether the jump of the virus from an animal to humans was a single accident or may frequently occur in future with the animals as dangerous reservoirs for future SARS epidemics remains unanswered. So far, the SARS-CoV has been reported to be able to infect not only humans but also macaque monkeys [11] , domestic cats, and ferrets [20] . However, transmission of the virus from the domestic cat to man has not been shown. The ability of the SARS-CoV to infect other animal species could point to potential natural reservoirs of the virus. In this respect, coronaviruses are known to relatively easily jump to other species. I.e., the human coronavirus OC43 shares a high degree of genetic sequence homology to bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and it is commonly assumed that it has jumped from one species to the other [21, 22] . In the same way, BCoV has been reported to be able to infect humans and cause diarrhea [23] .

We are unable to resolve the issue whether the cells were contaminated during preparation for many reasons, foremost being the company that sold the cells was merged with a different entity. It is unlikely that the RPTEC were infected in our laboratory, as we did not have HCoV-NL63 in our laboratory in 2004, and acquired HCoV-NL63 /Amsterdam-1 only recently (Sept. 2012) so that we could compare the biotype of HCoV-NL63/RPTEC with that of Amsterdam-1. Moreover, our laboratory policy dictates that workers refrain from cell culture work when they have a respiratory tract infection. It is plausible (but we lack proof) that HCoV-NL63 may have been latent in the donor's kidneys, a possibility consistent with the known biology of various coronaviruses that establish long-term but sub-clinical infections.

We detected diverse CoVs by RT-PCR in wild birds in the Beringia area. Sequence analysis showed that the detected viruses are gamma-coronaviruses related to IBV. These findings suggest that wild birds are able to carry gamma-coronaviruses asymptomatically. We concluded that CoVs are widespread among wild birds in Beringia, and their geographic spread and frequency is higher than previously realised. Thus, Avian CoV can be efficiently disseminated over large distances and could be a genetic reservoir for future emerging pathogenic CoVs. Considering the great animal health and economic impact of IBV as well as the recent emergence of novel coronaviruses such as SARScoronavirus, it is important to investigate the role of wildlife reservoirs in CoV infection biology and epidemiology.", "denotations": [{"id": "Disease_COVID-19", "phrase": "novel coronavirus", "start": 1289, "end": 1306}]}, {"text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was a new respiratory illness that emerged in China in 2003 and spread globally [1, 2] .

MERS-CoV is enzootic in DC across the Arabian Peninsula and in parts of Africa, causing mild upper respiratory tract illness in its camel reservoir and sporadic, but relatively rare human infections. Precisely how virus transmits to humans remains unknown but close and lengthy exposure appears to be a requirement. The KSA is the focal point of MERS, with the majority of human cases. In humans, MERS is mostly known as a lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease involving fever, cough, breathing difficulties and pneumonia that may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure and death in 20 % to 40 % of those infected. However, MERS-CoV has also been detected in mild and influenza-like illnesses and in those with no signs or symptoms. Older males most obviously suffer severe disease and MERS patients often have comorbidities. Compared to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), another sometimes-fatal zoonotic coronavirus disease that has since disappeared, MERS progresses more rapidly to respiratory failure and acute kidney injury (it also has an affinity for growth in kidney cells under laboratory conditions), is more frequently reported in patients with underlying disease and is more often fatal. Most human cases of MERS have been linked to lapses in infection prevention and control (IPC) in healthcare settings, with approximately 20 % of all virus detections reported among healthcare workers (HCWs) and higher exposures in those with occupations that bring them into close contact with camels. Sero-surveys have found widespread evidence of past infection in adult camels and limited past exposure among humans. Sensitive, validated reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-rtPCR)-based diagnostics have been available almost from the start of the emergence of MERS.

SARS-CoV infected about 8000 people, and resulted in the deaths of approximately 10% of those infected [11] . While MERS-CoV is not as widespread as SARS-CoV, it appears to have an even higher mortality rate, with 35-50% of diagnosed infections resulting in death [3, [12] [13] . These deadly betacoronavirus viruses existed in animal reservoirs [4] [5] 9, [14] [15] .

Luckily, till present, there is no evidence of SARS contamination in semen. Generally, influenza virus is a respiratory virus that causes respiratory tract infection. In the recent few years, an atypical influenza, avian flu, emerged. This infection brought a concern to the medical society. In early of this year, 2009, the newest emerging viral infection caused by a novel influenza virus, swine flu occurred and became pandemic. The topic on the new influenza virus becomes the present hot issue. Focusing on the contamination of classical influenza virus in semen, there are many evidences confirming the existence of virus in semen derived from the infected cases. It is also confirmed that the existence of the influenza virus in semen lead to decreased semen quality and pathological spermatozoa (6, 7) . For the case of avian flu and swine flu, there is no report on the existence of virus in the semen of infected cases at present (8) . However, a recent report on animal model indicated for the possibility of transmission of swine flu virus via reproductive tract insemination (9) . It is suggested that new atypical influenza can result in poor semen quality and might lead to further infertility (8) . However, there is no report on contamination of influenza virus in banked semen. A possible explanation might be the fact that although the influenza virus can contaminate in donated semen it leads to poor semen quality but no proof for possible further transmission to the other one.
