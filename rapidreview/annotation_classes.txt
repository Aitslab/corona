This is a list of the NER classes we aim to tag

Negation
Species
Virus_SARS-CoV-2
Virus_other
Disease_COVID-19
Disease_other
Symptom
Sympton_COVID-19
Protein_SARS-CoV-2
Protein_SARS-CoV-2-interactor
Protein_Other
Chemical
Epidemiology

Notes: 
Chemicals includes drugs
Symptom includes phenotypes (e.g. for cells or animals)
Protein_SARS-CoV-2-interactor includes host proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2
Epidemiology includes terms typically relevant for epidemiologists. Similar ones will be made for other profiles.


Discard for now:
Virus_family => include in annotations in class Virus_other instead


Rules for ressolving double annotations:
For double annotations of the same class the match with more characters is retained.
If one of the double annotations belongs to the class Epidemiology both annotations are retained
If a string is found in species and virus_sarscov2, virus_sarscov2 is kept and species tag is discarded.
If a string is found in disease and disease_covid19, disease_covid19 is kept and disease tag is discarded.
If a string is found in protein_sarscov2 and disease_covid19, disease_covid19 is kept and protein tag is discarded.
If a string is found in virus_sarscov2 and disease_covid19 the match with more characters is retained, e.g. SARS-Cov2 infection is tagged as disease_covid19 even though it also contains the virus name.
